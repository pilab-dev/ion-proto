# Application proto layer for ION based conference room 

The project is based on [buf.build](https://buf.build)

The original code comes from [ionorg](https://github.com/ionorg)

### Code generation

Edit the [buf.gen.yml](buf.gen.yaml) file to enable/disable generator plugins, and set the correct path where your proto files should be generated, then just run:
`buf generate` command to create language specific code.
